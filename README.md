# Project -1// Fraud Detection in Banking Transactions.

Objective
Develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time, helping banks minimize financial losses due to fraud.

Steps Involved
1. Problem Understanding
Banks face significant financial losses due to fraudulent transactions.
The goal is to classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate.
Key challenges include imbalanced data, real-time detection, and adaptive fraud techniques.


2. Data Collection
Use publicly available datasets like:
Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection
IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection Dataset
If real-world data is unavailable, generate synthetic data using tools like Faker or SMOTE.


3. Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values (if any).
Feature engineering:
Derive new features such as transaction frequency, amount thresholds, etc.
Encoding categorical variables.
Scaling numeric features using Min-Max Scaler.
Handling class imbalance using:
  *Oversampling (SMOTE)
  *Undersampling
  *Class weighting in models

   
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Transaction amount distribution (Boxplots, Histograms).
Fraud vs. Non-Fraud transaction patterns.
Feature correlations using heatmaps.
Time-series analysis of fraud occurrence.


5. Model Selection & Training
Use supervised learning algorithms:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
XGBoost
Neural Networks (Deep Learning)
Evaluate using:
Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curve.


6. Model Evaluation & Optimization
Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
Implement cost-sensitive learning to handle imbalanced data.
Use cross-validation to avoid overfitting.


7. Model Deployment (Optional)
Deploy using Flask/FastAPI as an API.
Integrate with a dashboard (Streamlit/Power BI) for visualization.
Use AWS Lambda/Azure Functions for real-time detection.


8. Code Implementation & GitHub Setup

10. Performance Monitoring & Future Enhancements
Implement real-time anomaly detection.
Use unsupervised learning (Autoencoders, Isolation Forest) for dynamic fraud detection.
Develop an adaptive fraud detection model with reinforcement learning.
